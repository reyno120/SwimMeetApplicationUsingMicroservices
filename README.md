<h1>
  Modern Software Architecture Patterns and Principles
 </h1>
 
The goal of this project is to demonstrate how to build well isolated, resilient, and testable applications using modern software architecture patterns and best practices.
   
<br />


## Project and Architecture Overview
The example used for this project is a swim meet planning and team management application. Different parts of the system are isolated from one other into highly autonomous, scalable, and independently deployable microservices that communicate asynchronously through an event bus. Within each microservice, patterns such as DDD, CQRS, and Event Sourcing are demonstrated to show how they may solve a particular problem. The rest of this documentation is dedicated to explaining the patterns used in each microservice and how/when it may be best to use them in your own application.
